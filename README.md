# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository hosts the Requirement Analysis Project, designed to guide learners through the essential phase of software development: requirement analysis. Centered around a booking management system, the project simulates a real-world scenario where participants document, analyze, and structure requirements with clarity and precision. The goal is to build a solid blueprint that lays the groundwork for successful and efficient project execution.
## What is Requirement Analysis
Requirement analysis is a critical process in software development lifecycle that involves gathering, evaluating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders to ensure the final product meets their requirements. This process ensures all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system is to do and how it is to perform.
